<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin pasta sheets alternating with a variety of ingredients.</p>
<p>Such as rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, cheese (typically mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta), and sometimes vegetables such as spinach or mushrooms. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lasagna noodles.</li>
  <li>Ground beef or Italian sausage (optional).</li>
  <li>Tomato sauce or marinara sauce.</li>
  <li>Ricotta cheese.</li>
  <li>Mozzarella cheese.</li>
  <li>Parmesan cheese.</li>
  <li>Onion and garlic (for flavor).</li>
  <li>Olive oil.</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper (to taste).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
  <li>Prepare noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Prepare sauce: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sauté until they're soft and translucent. Add ground beef or Italian sausage if using, cook until browned. Pour in your favorite tomato sauce or marinara sauce. Let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
  <li>Prepare ricotta mixture: In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, beaten eggs, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.</li>
  <li>Assemble lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Layer cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
  <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
  <li>Rest and serve: Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
